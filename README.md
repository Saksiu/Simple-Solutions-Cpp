# Simple-Solutions-Folder-Cpp
A list of simple and fun programs made to showcase my basic coding abilities in the C++ language.

1. BinaryGuesser - Guess an user's random number in the range from 1 to 1,000,000 in 20 tries or less using binary search
2. MonotonicRow - The longest "line" of numbers constantly increasing or decreasing is returned as the answer for each of the rows.
3. SumOfTwo - given a sorted vector of Integers, find a pair of elements that sum up to a val value.
